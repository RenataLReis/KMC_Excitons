# KMC_Excitions
A software that simulates exciton dynamics based on Kinetic Monte Carlo

Run python3 excitons1D_2.py <excitons_number> <rounds_number> to generate results.
Uncommenting indicated lines it is possible to activate more materials and more details of the simulations (such as trajectories).
Parameters can be varied by hard coding.

Use compile.sh to run the program for several <excitons_number>.

gaussian3.py, med_ensemble.py and var.py might be runned to annalyze the generated data.
